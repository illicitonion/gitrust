# gitrust

gitrust exposes an HTTP interface to perform git actions.

It is intended to be used as a backend for https://github.com/Kegsay/github-pull-review filling in areas where the Github APIs aren't sufficient for its needs, e.g. to perform squash-merges.

It is my first Rust, so is almost certainly terrible.
